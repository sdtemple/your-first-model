# Building your first AI model

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

This repository is built to accomodate at workshop and hack-a-thon at University of Michigan. The goal is to build an AI model from scratch that performs a classification task (which bird species is vocalizing). The target audience is STEM professionals with some amount of coding experience, but not necessarily ML/Statistics researchers and Python experts.

Advertisement for event: Making your first neural network can be intimidating, and just looking at code and online videos isn't the same learning experience as a hands-on exercise. From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, we will cover the basics of tree ensemble methods for tabular data, convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for image data, and developing and publishing your model on Hugging Face. From 12 to 1 PM, we will have lunch provided. From 1:00 to 2:00 PM, there will be a guest speaker presenting on data visualization. From 2 to 5 PM, we will split into groups of 2-3 to build models predicting which of 20 bird species (categorical classification) can be identified based on acoustic data and metadata. Workshop facilitators will be available to assist and provide guidance to the groups. Starter code examples and some preprocessed code will be provided to focus on modeling and make the hack-a-thon accessible to all expertise levels.

## The data

Much of the data comes from the Kaggle BirdClef competitions.
- [BirdCLEF 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2025)
- [BirdCLEF 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2024)
- [BirdCLEF 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2023)
- [BirdCLEF 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2022)
- [BirdCLEF 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2021)

I also included acoustics data that are not bird sounds from the following.

I processed the data to include the acoustics of XXX species. More details:
